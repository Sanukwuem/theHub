This project allows users to have all the different websites they visit right on their homepage. The scheduling app allows you to add dates and then schedule events for that specific date.

This project is very unique because it allows users to never have to leave a page once they visit the website. This is a concept that has not yet been explored by developers. Additionally, after you create an event in the scheduling app, you set a priority and the events are listed in the order of highest priority which is great for anyone who wants to keep up with the important tasks they have for that day.
