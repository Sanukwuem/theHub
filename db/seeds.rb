# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

#t1 = Notebook.create(title: "Notebook1")


#Note.create(name: "Note11", description: "This is the first note", notebook_id: t1.id)
#Note.create(name: "Note21", description: "This is the second note", notebook_id: t1.id)
